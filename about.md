I'm an HPC Engineer focused on computational performance optimization. My background is in computational science and numerical methods.

## Background

- **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering**, Mississippi State University (2022)
- **Postdoctoral Research Associate**, Los Alamos National Laboratory (2022-2024)
- **Current Role**: High-Performance Computing Engineer

## Technical Areas

- Parallel and distributed computing
- GPU computing and acceleration
- Performance optimization and profiling
- Scientific computing and numerical methods
- Cross-platform software development

## Recent Work

I work on performance-critical computational problems, including parallel algorithm development and cross-platform optimization. Recently contributed to the [Fierro computational mechanics software](https://github.com/lanl/Fierro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, which received a [2024 R&D 100 Award](https://x.com/RD100Awards/status/1840772114401398867){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Selected Publications

- "A parallel and performance portable implementation of a full-field crystal plasticity model" — *Computer Physics Communications* (2024)
- "Three-dimensional Phase-field simulation of γ'' precipitation kinetics in Inconel 625 during heat treatment" — *Computational Materials Science* (2021)
